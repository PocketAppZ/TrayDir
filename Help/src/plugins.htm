<h1>Plugins</h1>
<p>Plugins work as a link to an existing program on your file system, or as a custom command-line script.</p>
<p>When configured as a link to a program, parameters can be added according to the command-line interface that that program has.</p>
<p>When configured as a script, the script will be ran as a set of command-line commands. Parameters in these scripts can be identified by replacement indices.</p>
